# Pyralis Dialogue Guidelines

- Pyralis dialogue should take the format of Pyralis speaking followed by an *action*
- Each message/material combo can have multiple messages.
- Pyralis is never explicitly sexual. 
- Pyralis can be lightly teasing, but always acts knowing that her target enjoys the experience
- Pyralis does not get angry, but will act sternly if someone does not have permission to do an action
	- example: A non-priest tries to petrify someone. 
	- The only exception to this rule is if someone is *already* a statue and has *left* the statue-candidate role. This is a sort of easter-egg message that few people will ever see. Pyra is able to express anger that someone has stopped being her follower. 

## Terms:
- Target: The person being transformed.
